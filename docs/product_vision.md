# Sigarra Eye Candy

## Product Vision

`Sigarra Eye Candy` is an Android and iOS app that aims to ease the process of finding course related information, such as its planification and evaluation, and the provided study materials through a simple and intuitive interface.

All current alternatives to our product, such as Sigarra, lack a responsive design, leaving mobile users deprived of access to content that is fundamental to any student.

Therefore, our goal is to provide, to every FEUP student, all the information they would find on their college platform to the palm of their hands, whenever and wherever they need it.

## Main Features

- List of curricular units - The students are able to see a list of their past and present curricular units;
- General information on curricular units - The students are able to see general information on each of their curricular units, such as planification and final grade formula;
- Study Material - The students are able to see the provided study material avalaible for each curricular unit on SIGARRA; 
- Grades - The students are able to see the grades they attained on their past and present curricular units;
- Teachers and Peers - The students are able to see who is lecturing their past and present curricular units and who is attending those lectures.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

Our product's only foreseeable external dependency is the SIGARRA API.
